# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is just a place where I am working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file which uses *markup syntax* to produce a document that others can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following
- How to make a repository
- How to publish a repository using **GitHub Desktop**
- How to make commits to a repo

Let's give it a go :) Also, try out [Introduction to GitHub] (https://github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
